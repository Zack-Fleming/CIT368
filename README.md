# CIT368 - Secure Software Development

This repository is s collection of assignments I developed in Java. 


## Weather Application

This assignment was done in two sets of commits. One where we just make a basic waether application using any weather API, and another where we apply secure software development practices. Due to the APi being leaked in the first version, the API key has been removed and regenerated. The secure practices implemented, include:
 - Application Partitioning
 - Input validation & Sanitation
 - Secrets
 - Error Handling
 - Static Code Testing (SAST)
 - Unit Testing
 - Logging
 - Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)

#### Static Code Analysis (SCA\SAST)

The tool I use was Qodana, an SCA tool that is prebundled with the Intellij IDE. 

#### Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)
